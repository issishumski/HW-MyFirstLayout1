            <p class="whoRight">Hi, my name is Issi Shumski. I am currently pursuing UX/UI design, completing a course from University of California, Irvine in March of 2020. I come originally from a theater and performance background, graduating with my BA is Drama with an Acting Emphasis in June 2018. I love understanding and connecting with why humans do what they do. Through design, I hope to continue my exploration on what people respond to and why they do.</p>
